Fertilizers Recommendation System For Disease Prediction

Introduction:

Agriculture is the most important sector in todayâ€™s life. Most plants are affected by a wide variety of bacterial and fungal diseases. Diseases on plants placed a major constraint on the production and a major threat to food security. Hence, early and accurate identification of plant diseases is essential to ensure high quantity and best quality. In recent years, the number of diseases on plants and the degree of harm caused has increased due to the variation in pathogen varieties, changes in cultivation methods, and inadequate plant protection techniques.

An automated system is introduced to identify different diseases on plants by checking the symptoms shown on the leaves of the plant. Deep learning techniques are used to identify the diseases and suggest the precautions that can be taken for those diseases.

Project Flow:

A web Application is built  where 

Farmers can interact with the portal build

Interacts with the user interface to upload images of diseased leaf

Our model built analyses the Disease and suggests the farmer with fertilizers are to be used 

Pre-Requisites:

1)Anaconda Navigator

Anaconda Navigator is a free and open-source distribution of the Python and R programming languages for data science and machine learning-related applications. It can be installed on Windows, Linux, and macOS.

2)Tensor flow

TensorFlow is an end-to-end open-source platform for machine learning. It has a comprehensive, flexible ecosystem of tools, libraries, and community resources that lets researchers push the state-of-the-art in ML and developers can easily build and deploy ML powered applications.
